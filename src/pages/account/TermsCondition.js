        2.3 If the value of a deposit is not played through in full before a
        withdrawal is requested, bet365 reserves the right to make a charge to
        the customer’s account to cover all reasonable costs relating to both
        the deposit and withdrawal. If necessary, the value of the withdrawal
        requested may be reduced accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.4 If the deposit method of the account is paysafecard and the value of
        a deposit is not played through in full before a withdrawal is
        requested, or there is any evidence of a series of bets/wagers placed
        which results in guaranteed customer profits irrespective of the
        outcome, or where all the betting/wagering is determined to be low risk,
        bet365 reserves the right to request a receipt showing proof of purchase
        of the voucher before any withdrawals are processed.
      </p>
      <h4>3. Other</h4>
      <p>
        3.1 If we incur any charge-backs, reversals or other charges in respect
        of your account, we reserve the right to charge you for the relevant

        3.2 We may, at any time, set off any positive balance on your account
        against any amounts owed by you to bet365 or any company within the
        bet365 group.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.3 You are responsible for reporting your winnings and losses to the
        tax and/or other authorities in your jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.4 Internet gambling may be illegal in the jurisdiction in which you
        are located. If so, you are not authorised to use your payment card to
        complete the transaction. However, any bets/wagers accepted from such
        jurisdictions will stand - win or lose.
      </p>
      <h3>D. BETTING PROCEDURES</h3>
      <h4>1. Placing Bets/Wagers</h4>
      <p>
        1.1 bet365 reserves the right to decline all, or part, of any bet/wager
        requested at its sole and absolute discretion. All bets/wagers are
        placed at your own risk and discretion.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        1.2 We only accept bets/wagers made online (including via mobile device
        or downloadable applications on a mobile device) or by telephone.
        Bets/wagers are not accepted in any other form (post, email, fax, etc.)
        and where received will be invalid and void - win or lose.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.3 It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure details of their
        bets/wagers are correct. Once bets/wagers have been placed they may not
        be cancelled by the customer. Bets can only be changed by the customer
        using our Edit Bet feature, where this is available. bet365 reserves the
        right to cancel any bet/wager at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        1.4 Where Find my Game is used to search and navigate to an In-Play
        betting coupon for a televised game, please ensure you check the betslip
        before placing a bet. It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure
        the correct coupon is loaded for the required event. Once bets/wagers
        have been placed they may not be cancelled by the customer.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        1.5 Your funds will be allocated to bets/wagers in the order they are
        placed and will not be available for any other use. bet365 reserves the
        right to void and/or reverse any transactions made after a bet/wager has
        been placed involving allocated funds, either at the time or
        retrospectively.
      </p>
      <h4>2. Bet/Wager Confirmation</h4>
      <p>
        2.1 Bets/wagers will not be valid if there are insufficient funds in
        your account.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        2.2 For telephone bets/wagers 'acceptance confirmed' will be deemed only
        after an operator has completed a full read back of the bet/wager
        details and confirmed to the customer that the bet/wager has been
        successfully processed and accepted.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        2.3 A bet/wager that you request will only be valid once accepted by
        bet365’s servers. Each valid bet/wager will receive a unique transaction
        code. We shall not be liable for the settlement of any bets/wagers which
        are not issued with a unique transaction code. If you are unsure about
        the validity of a bet/wager, please check your account history, or
        Contact Us.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.4 Notwithstanding the above, if bets/wagers are placed via a credit or
        debit card they are not valid until we have received payment in full.
        The bet/wager will be automatically void if we have not received the
        payment prior to the relevant event commencing.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        2.5 Should a dispute arise, you and bet365 agree that the bet365
        transaction log database will be the ultimate authority in such matters.{" "}
      </p>
      <h4>3. Offers</h4>
      <p>
        3.1 Where any term of an offer or promotion is breached or there is any
        evidence of a series of bets placed by a customer or group of customers,
        which due to enhanced payments, Free Bets, refund payments, Bet Credits
        or any other promotional offer results in guaranteed customer profits
        irrespective of the outcome, whether individually or as part of a group,
        bet365 may reclaim the enhanced payment, Free Bet, refund payment or Bet
        Credit element of such offers and/or void any bet funded by the Free Bet
        or Bet Credits. In addition, where there is evidence of such activity,
        bet365 may levy an administration charge on the customer up to the value
        of the Bet Credits, Free Bet, refund payment or enhanced payment towards
        the administrative costs incurred in identifying and taking action
        against the activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.2 bet365 may reclaim any bonus amounts, Free Bets, Bet Credits, refund
        amounts or enhanced payments that have been awarded in error.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.3 All customer offers are limited to one per person. If bet365 has
        reasonable grounds to suspect that a bonus or offer is being claimed by
        or for the benefit of the same person more than once or by a group of
        people then it may withdraw the availability of any offer or all offers
        to that customer or group of customers and/or void any bet funded by the
        bonus or offer and remove any winnings from such bet.
      </p>
      <p>
        3.4 bet365 may, at any time, make minor amendments to the terms and
        conditions of any offer or promotion to correct typographical errors or
        to improve on clarity or customer experience and may cancel any offer or
        promotion for legal or regulatory reasons.
      </p>
      <h4>4. Settlement and Payouts</h4>
      <p>
        4.1 All bets and wagers are subject to the Betting Coverage provisions
        (including maximum winnings) set out in Appendix Two to these Terms and
        Conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.2 bet365 reserves the right to suspend a market and/or cancel any
        bet/wager at anytime. When a market is suspended any bets entered will
        be rejected. bet365 also reserves the right to cease betting on any
        markets at any time without notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.3 The 'To Return' calculation available on the Website is for
        information purposes only, and all bets will be calculated using the
        stake/risk at the odds accepted. In multiple bets/parlays with a void
        selection(s) the 'To Return' figure is reduced accordingly. This
        includes selections that have been made void where ‘Void if player does
        not start’ is selected at bet placement.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.4 Should a customer include a non-runner or void selection in a
        multiple bet/parlay, the bet will be settled on the remaining
        selections. This includes selections that have been made void where
        ‘Void if player does not start’ is selected at bet placement.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.5 Winnings from settled bets/wagers are added to the balance of your
        betting account. Any funds/winnings credited to an account in error are
        not available for use, and bet365 reserves the right to void any
        transactions involving such funds and/or withdraw the relevant amount
        from your account and/or reverse the transaction, either at the time or
        retrospectively.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        4.6 bet365 reserves the right to withhold payment and to declare bets on
        an event void if we have evidence that the following has occurred: (i)
        the integrity of the event has been called into question; (ii) the
        price(s) or pool has been manipulated; or (iii) match rigging has taken
        place. Evidence of the above may be based on the size, volume or pattern
        of bets placed with bet365 across any or all of our betting channels. A
        decision given by the relevant governing body of the sport in question
        (if any) will be conclusive. If any customer owes any money to bet365
        for any reason, we have the right to take that into account before
        making any payments to that customer.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.7 Where there is evidence of a series of bets each containing the same
        selection(s) having been placed by or for the same individual or
        syndicate of individuals, bet365 reserves the right to make bets void or
        withhold payment of returns pending the outcome of any subsequent
        investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.8 For events where there is no official 'off' declared, the advertised
        start time of the event will be deemed the 'off'. If for any reason a
        bet is inadvertently accepted after an event or match has commenced
        (other than live In-Play betting clearly indicated on the Website), bets
        will stand providing the final outcome is not known, and that no
        participant/team has gained any material advantage (e.g. a score,
        sending off for the other team, etc) at the time the bet was placed. If
        the outcome of an event/market is known bet365 reserves the right to
        void the bet, win or lose. Disputes over times bets are placed will be
        settled using the transaction log. All times stated on the Website
        and/or referred to by bet365 staff relate to UK Time unless stated
        otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.9 In-Play betting - where we have reason to believe that a bet is
        placed after the outcome of an event is known, or after the selected
        participant or team has gained a material advantage (e.g. a score,
        sending off for the other team etc) we reserve the right to void the
        bet, win or lose.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        4.10 If for any reason we are unable to validate the outcome of a
        particular market (e.g. due to loss of live pictures), all bets will be
        void, unless settlement of bets is already determined.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.11 Where a customer gives ambiguous instructions, bet365 reserves the
        right to split the amount of monies staked between the potential
        outcomes. Where this is impractical we reserve the right to void the
        whole of that bet. In any event, the decision of bet365 is final.
