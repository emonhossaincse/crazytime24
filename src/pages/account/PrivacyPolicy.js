          the “data controller” for the purposes of applicable European data
          protection legislation.
        </p>
        <h3>Contacting us</h3>
        <p>
          If you have any concerns, or would like more detail about how we process
          your Personal Data, you can contact us using data.protection@bet365.com.
        </p>
        <h3>Protecting Your Personal Data</h3>
        <p>
          Your Personal Data isn’t just protected by the quality, commitment and
          high standards of bet365, it’s also protected by law. The law states
          that we can only process your Personal Data when there is a genuine
          reason to do so and it must be one of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>To fulfil any contract that we have with you</li>
          <li>We have a legal obligation</li>
          <li>Where you have consented to the processing</li>
          <li>When it is in our legitimate interest</li>
          <li>When it is in the public interest</li>
          <li> When it is in your vital interests</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Legitimate Interests</h3>
        <p>
          When we have a business or commercial reason to process your Personal
          Data this is referred to as a legitimate interest. Your Personal Data is
          still protected and we must not process it in a way that would be unfair
          to you or your interests.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we do use legitimate interests as a reason to process your Personal
          Data we will tell you that we are doing so, what our legitimate
          interests are and provide you with a method to raise any questions or
          objections you may have. However, compelling grounds for processing such
          information may over-ride your right to object.
        </p>
        <h3>How long we keep your Personal Data</h3>
        <p>
          Whenever your data is kept by bet365 we will ensure that it is
          appropriately protected and only used for acceptable purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will keep your data for the period that you are a customer of bet365.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are no longer a customer of bet365, we will keep your data for
          the minimum length of time required to comply with the purposes set out
          in this policy and relevant legal or regulatory obligations. Your
          Personal Data may be kept longer if we cannot delete it for technical
          reasons.
        </p>
        <h3>Why we process your Personal Data</h3>
        <img src="../img/eng.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          If you choose not to provide your Personal Data it may prevent us from
          meeting legal obligations, fulfilling a contract, or performing services
          required to run your account. Not providing your Personal Data may mean
          we are unable to provide you with products or services.
        </p>
        <h3>Information Collected</h3>
        <p>
          The information and data about you which we may collect, use and process
          includes the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Information that you provide to us by filling in forms on the Website
            or any other information you submit to us via the Website or email
          </li>
          <li>
            Records of correspondence, whether via the Website, email, telephone
            or other means
          </li>
          <li>
            Your responses to surveys or customer research that we carry out
          </li>
          <li>
            Details of the transactions you carry out with us, whether via the
            Website, telephone or other means
          </li>
          <li>
            Details of your visits to the Website including, but not limited to,
            traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Where it is reasonable for us to do so and not detrimental to your
          rights and freedoms, we also collect Personal Data from publicly
          available sources such as internet searches, Companies House, and
          broadcast media.
        </p>
        <h3>Telephone Calls</h3>
        <p>
          Telephone calls to and from our Customer Contact Centre are recorded for
          training and security purposes along with the resolution of any queries
          arising from the service you receive.
        </p>
        <h3>Social Features of Our Products</h3>
        <p>
          If you choose to participate in any of the social features that we

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Depending on the products you choose to use we may need to share your
          Personal Data with the third parties that provide those services. Where
          your Personal Data are transferred outside of the European Economic Area
          (“EEA”), we require that appropriate safeguards are in place.

          associated or subsidiary companies and to business partners, or
          successors in title to our business.
        </p>
        <h3>Data Transfer Outside the EEA</h3>
        <p>We will only transfer your Personal Data outside of the EEA where: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You have given your explicit consent, or</li>
          <li>
            It is necessary for us to set up or fulfil a contract you have entered
            into with us; or
          </li>
          <li>To comply with a legal duty or obligation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If we do transfer your Personal Data outside of the EEA, within the
          group or to our business partners, we will take measures to ensure it is
          protected to the same standards as it would be within the EEA by relying
          on one of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The country that is receiving your Personal Data has been found by the
            European Commission to offer the same level of protection as the EEA.
            More information can be found on the European Commission Justice
            website.
          </li>
          <li>
            We will use contracts that require the recipient to protect your
            Personal Data to the same standards as it would be within the EEA
          </li>
          <li>
            {" "}
            Standard contractual clauses or binding corporate rules or any other
            acceptable method that ensures a protection of your personal
            information to the standard required within the EEA
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In some instances we may be compelled by law to disclose your Personal
          Data to a third party and may have limited control over how it is
          protected by that party.
        </p>
